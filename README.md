Bones Beneath

Team members: Zahara, Cori, Harris, Meghan

Welcome to Bones Beneath, an immersive archaeological adventure where you embark on a journey to uncover ancient secrets, solve puzzles, and collect treasures while exploring mysterious ruins! Play as an archaeologist, dig for dinosaur bones, and build a museum filled with the skeletons of ancient creatures. Your adventure will test your reflexes, strategy, and knowledge of archaeology. Can you dig deep enough to uncover all the ancient treasures?

Mission Statement:

Our project aims to offer an exciting and educational journey as an archaeologist! In Bones Beneath, players will unearth hidden treasures, decipher ancient codes, and collect valuable artifacts as they explore the world of dinosaurs and ancient civilizations. Players will progressively unlock new tools and build their museum, all while learning about the fascinating world of archaeology.

Problem Statement:

There is a lack of engaging educational games that effectively teach players about dinosaurs and archaeology. Most current games either fail to hold the player's interest or donâ€™t have a solid progression system that encourages learning. Our game addresses this gap by combining fun, interactive gameplay with educational content, ensuring that players can learn about archaeology and dinosaurs while enjoying a challenging and rewarding experience.
